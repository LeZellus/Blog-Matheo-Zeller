## Getting started
If you are a developer and you want to install the application on local, you need to follow those steps :

### 1-1 | Create Database
The first step is to create Database, you have 2 ways to do that :
-   You can go on your local database software and add manually database (on mysql for exemple)
-   Copy the lines into `sql/STEP0-createDatabase.sql` and paste on your local database software in "SQL" section

Next , you can do the same thing to create tables and seeds (coming soon) with the file `sql/STEP1-insertOnDatabase.sql`

You are now ready to continue the install.
